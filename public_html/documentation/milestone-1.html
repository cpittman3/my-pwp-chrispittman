      <h3>Mark Yang, Age 27</h3>
        <p> <!-- Technology -->
            Mark owns a 16-inch M1 MacBook Pro running Big Sur OS,
            <br>
            iPhone 12 iOS 14 A14 Bionic chip, and

        </p>
        <!-- Proficiency and Role-->
        <p>
            Mark is fairly tech-savvy, prefers Apple devices and could be described as a power user.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Scenario -->
    <div>
         <p>
             Mark is an author who prefers to create his own cover art. He is proficient with Poser Pro and has
             <br>
             a good understanding of advanced lighting such as IBL and ray tracing techniques. Most models he
             <br>
             needs are available through Poser's content store, however, he also needs custom models that are
             <br>
             unique to his books such as characters and creatures.
         </p>

         <!-- User Story -->
         <p>
            As a power user I expect to get a quick overview of the artist's capabilities and availability without sorting through clutter
         </p>

        <!-- Wants and Needs -->
         <p>
             Mark prefers High quality high-poly models. He needs them to be rigged in a method that is compatible with
             <br>
             Poser Pro. He needs a full range of texture maps that meet industry standards and take advantage of
             <br>
             modern lighting techniques. He needs for the models to be presented in multiple formats that are compatible
             <br>
             with Poser Pro and retain necessary data.
         </p>

        <!-- Frustrations -->
         <p>
             Mark does not want an artist who does not maintain regular contact and visual updates on the model.
             <br>
             The Artist must be able to complete the models in a reasonable amount of time.
             <br>
             He does not want an artist unwilling to create the model based on his specifications.
         </p>

         <!-- Goal -->
         <p>
            Mark's main goal is to assess my abilities and to be able to contact me if he wants to hire me.
         </p>

         <!-- Additional information -->
         <p>
            Additional information Mark would need to know would be my current availability.
